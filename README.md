# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Homework 1
In this repository you will find my commits regarding the first homework assignment. In this assignment I was challenged to clean code, resulting in the follwoing changes made to the original code:

- Cases in which semantic elements may be used
- Unneccessary identical classes on the CSS stylesheet
- Fixing the arrangement of html and CSS sheets
- Adding missing parts of html tags
- Adding comments

The site still functions exactly as it did before the changes were made.
